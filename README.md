# **The illegal flights of the first lady of Argentina, during the Pandemic lockdown.**
---	
  
## **Project objectives.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to analyze, separately, the replies of the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Argentine Nation and from Argentinean Air Navigation Company, State-owned company (EANA SE, in Spanish), regarding the requests for access to public information on the flights of the first lady, Fabiola Yáñez.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective is to cross-check the data of both answers, in order to detect inconsistencies. In case of finding them, verify which is true, which is not, or if both are false.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective is to detect if the first lady always traveled as a companion of the President of Argentina, Alberto Ángel Fernández. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, graph the findings.

## **Project findings.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first finding was that the General Secretariat of the Presidency of Argentina lied in its response to the request for access to public information. The agency did not include all the flights of the First Lady and, on the other hand, altered some of the data of several of the flights. This emerged from crossing both answers. The information provided by EANA SE was collected from each airport in the country.

A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)
Data used for analysis – note that if your data is 100MB+, you can't host it on GitHub. That's fine, just add the file to your .gitignore
Notebooks used for data collection and analysis
Your notebooks should include some Markdown cells at the top that explain what you're doing in the notebook. Ideally you also sprinkle commentary/questions throughout the notebook.
A .gitignoreLinks to an external site. file to keep out any files you don't actually want in the project
A link to the project page (you can add a link in your README, or by clicking the gear icon next to "About" on the right-hand side of your repo)
