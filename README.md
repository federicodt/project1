# **The illegal flights of the first lady of Argentina, during the Pandemic lockdown.**

## **Project objectives.**
  The first objective is to analyze, separately, the replies of the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Argentine Nation and EANA SE, regarding the requests for access to public information on the flights of the first lady, Fabiola Yáñez.
  The second objective is to cross-check the data of both answers, in order to detect inconsistencies. In case of finding them, verify which is true, which is not, or if both are false.
  The third objective is to detect if the first lady always traveled as a companion of the President of Argentina, Alberto Ángel Fernández. 
  Finally, graph the findings.
